## Requirement

Forked Goose's TBW version that provide REST API from: https://github.com/qvanphong/core2_tbw (use **solar** branch if you are using for Solar Network)

## Customize configuration
#### Change API URL
Set up your API URL in `config.json` file at root and change the value of `api_url`.
The API URL must point my API that forked Goose's TBW.

 #### Customize block items
Edit `BlockContainer.vue` at `src/components`, add/remove/custom blocks from there by edit `BlockItem` attribute.
By using other icons, edit `main.js` at `src` and add your icon that you want into this
`import { faMoon, faSun, faChartPie, faRankingStar, faList, faBars, faUserGroup, faMoneyBill, faHammer, YOUR_NEW_ICON_NAME } from  "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";`

then add it to library:
`library.add(faMoon, faSun, faChartPie, faRankingStar, faList, faBars, faUserGroup, faMoneyBill, faHammer, YOUR_NEW_ICON_NAME )`

These icon is from Font Awesome Free Solid SVGs, so you can find the icon that you want from https://fontawesome.com/icons/
